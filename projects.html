						<p><span class="bold">iRadio</span>: iRadio is a music streaming mobile application developed for America Móvil, the major mobile service provider in Mexico and Latin America. It is available for Android, iOS, Blackberry, J2ME and Windows Phone. You can listen to over 100 radio stations and create custom stations based on your favorite songs, albums or artists. I have been involved in developing new features and giving maintenance to the API, using C#.NET. Also, I have worked on J2ME and Blackberry versions, from fixing bugs to implementing some minor new features. The most important work of all, has been in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Mobzilla.Player" target="_blank">Android version</a>. I have implemented new features and fixed bugs in the old version. Right now, I am in charge of the completely new version for Android, and I have been involved in the software and graphical design, implementation and bug fixing of this new version. You can see an image gallery of iRadio <a href="iradio_old.html">old version</a>, and some screenshots from the <a href="iradio_new.html">new version</a>.

						<p><span class="bold">The Reionization and Transients Infrared/Optical Project (RATIR)</span>: This was the project I worked on in my Masters Degree. I proposed several mechanical designs for the mechanic support for the dichroics that this instrument uses. Then I analysed each design and with Finite Element Method I simulated the deformations that the support generates in the dichroic. Also, using CNC I manufactured a model to take measurements in the laboratory. My <a href="files/ismot_ratir.pdf" target="_blank">project was selected to be presented</a> at the International Symposium on Microwave and Optical Technology in Prague, Czech Republic on June 2011.</p>
